Using Metaheuristic Algorithms to Determine Where to Build Mental Health Facilities for Underserved Population Areas in the United States: a Constrained Budget Location-Allocation Problem
======

The United States Department of Health & Human Services has a Division of Policy and Shortage Designation that collects data on geographic areas, populations, and facilities with too few primary care, dental and mental health providers and services. This paper uses a publicly available dataset published by the Health Resources & Services Administration about the population per state that is a Health Professional Shortage Area or a Medically Underserved Area/Population for mental health providers. Assuming the Division were awarded a budget to establish new mental health clinics in the United States and they could build a maximum of one facility per state, this paper employs the use of two metaheuristic algorithms, a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm, to determine where to optimally locate the clinics to stay within the budget and ensure at least 80% of demand is covered. Both algorithms produced the same optimal solution, suggesting building five facilities, creating a total coverage of 82.6%.
